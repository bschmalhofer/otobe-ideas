# Introduction

## Who am I ?

- Bernhard Schmalhofer from Munich.pm
- First dabbled with Perl in 1990 while studying physics in Regensburg and at the MPE
- Some years in bioinformatics
- Freelancing since 2008
- Became involved with OTOBO in 2020



## What is this talk about ?

- Advertising: Tell people about the success story OTOBO
- Share findings from modernizing an application with a long history



## What is OTOBO ?

- an open source web based ticketing system, where ticketing refers to help desk, not to concerts
- forked from OTRS in 2019 by Rother OSS
- supports ITSM, that is IT Service Management
- see the [demo](https://demo.otobo.org/otobo/index.pl) with login Lena/Lena



## What is [PSGI](https://metacpan.org/pod/PSGI) and [Plack](https://plackperl.org/) ?

- PSGI is an interface for running Perl based application in many environments
- Plack is the reference implementation.

# traditional OTOBO 10.0

- Apache 2.4 with **mpm_prefork** and **mod_perl**
- CGI scripts running under `ModPerl::Registry`
- relational database in the backend
- Template Toolkit in the frontend
- in between a lot of interface modules, not really a framework


## Excursion 1: [ModPerl::Registry](https://metacpan.org/dist/mod_perl/view/docs/api/ModPerl/Registry.pod)

ModPerl::Registry takes a CGI-script

    #!/usr/bin/env perl
    use v5.30;

    use CGI;

    my $cgi = CGI->new;

    print
        $cgi->header(
            -type       => 'text/html',
            -charset    => 'utf-8',
        ),
        '<h1>Hallo üåç!</h1>';


and turns it into an mod\_perl request handler

    package ModPerl::ROOT::ModPerl::Registry::opt_otobo_bin_cgi_2dbin_hallo_welt_2epl;
    sub handler {local $0 = '/opt/otobo/bin/cgi-bin/hallo_welt.pl';
    #line 1 /opt/otobo/bin/cgi-bin/hallo_welt.pl
    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    use v5.30;

    use CGI;

    my $cgi = CGI->new;
    print
        $cgi->header(
            -type       => 'text/html',
            -charset    => 'utf-8',
        ),
        '<h1>Hallo üåç!</h1>';
    }


and somewhere the environment variables and STDIN are set up



# OTOBO 10.0 under Docker with PSGI

- initial requirement was that customers have a simple way of running OTOBO
- prior art by <https://hub.docker.com/r/juanluisbaptiste/otrs/>.
- see [Installing using Docker and Docker Compose](https://doc.otobo.org/manual/installation/10.0/en/content/installation-docker.html)



## Here is a quick runthrough.

- Docker support for OTOBO is based on the official [Perl Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/perl) image.
- The base image is declared in [otobo.web.dockerfile](https://github.com/RotherOSS/otobo/blob/rel-10_0/otobo.web.dockerfile#L10).
- Starting a Docker container runs [entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/RotherOSS/otobo/blob/rel-10_0/bin/docker/entrypoint.sh#L114).
- **plackup** uses [otobo.psgi](https://github.com/RotherOSS/otobo/blob/rel-10_0/bin/psgi-bin/otobo.psgi#L638).
- Orchestration is done with Docker compose.


## Why Plack and not *your favorite framework* ?

- there was no apparent immediate benefit 
- the required changes should be kept to a minimum.


## Why [Gazelle](https://metacpan.org/pod/Gazelle) ?

- advertised as "a Preforked Plack Handler for performance freaks"
- preforking actually is a requirement.


## [CGI::Emulate::PSGI](https://metacpan.org/pod/CGI::Emulate::PSGI)

- just about no code adaptions needed
- add the wrapper in [otobo.psgi](https://github.com/RotherOSS/otobo/blob/rel-10_0/bin/psgi-bin/otobo.psgi#L509)
- then the [venerable CGI.pm](https://github.com/RotherOSS/otobo/blob/rel-10_0/Kernel/System/Web/Request.pm#L93) can kick in.


## a persistent volume is required

- the directory structure of _/opt/otobo_ is a bit intertwined
- OTOBO packages are installed into the same directories as core OTOBO
- even worse, packages may overwrite files in core OTOBO
- cache files are also written in _/opt/otobo_
- solved by using a [Docker volume](https://github.com/RotherOSS/otobo-docker/blob/rel-10_0/docker-compose/otobo-base.yml#L61) 



# OTOBO 10.1 The real thing

- using the Plack App **otobo.psgi** in all scenarios
- Plack::Handler::Apache2 when running under Apache
- wrapper scripts using **Modperl::Registry** as a fallback

The query parameters are no longer extracted from the environment variables. The PSGI `$Env` is used instead.

## Reading from STDIN

- no more reading from STDIN
- in OTOBO 10.0 there were already fallbacks to using the query objects
- so the reads from STDIN could be eliminated
- Do not consider only POSTDATA. PUT and PATCH are also relevant.

    # The body supplied by POST, PUT, and PATCH has already been read in. This should be safe
    # as $CGI::POST_MAX has been set as an emergency brake.
    # For Checking the length we can therefor use the actual length.
    my $Content = $ParamObject->GetParam( Param => uc($RequestMethod) . 'DATA' );


## Writing to STDOUT

- pass back the content.


## Exiting

- throw an exception.


## Setting headers

- collect the headers in the response object
- attach the content later
- finally call `Plack::Response::finalize()`

## Exiting

- Throw an exception


## Long polling, Comet

- is not relevant for OTOBO
- could be implemented by returning a sub in the PSGI response
- this approach is planned to be used for delivering attachments


## Encoding

- decoding and encoding is still done in a bad way
- ... but it works
