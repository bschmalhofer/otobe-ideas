# otobo-ideas: Just some notes OTOBO

OTOBO is an open source ticketing system derived from ((OTRS)) Community Edition.

Here be only some ramblings.

## Ideas

### Use Github Issues for bugtracking

Bugzilla is so 2000s. I talked to Stefan about that and he decided that Issues should be used. Thanks for the nice Brotzeit by the way! https://github.com/RotherOSS/doc-otobo-installation/issues/1 is the first real issue. https://github.com/RotherOSS/otobo/issues/1 had been inadvertently added.

### Tighten the requirements

* Define the supported Linux and FreeBSD distributions
* Find the minimal Perl version
* Find the minimal MySQL version
* Find the minimal Postgres version
* Find the minimal Apache2 version
* Document the found versions
* Check the requirments

### Other ideas

* Check the installation instructions
* cpanfile
* PSGI
* Starman
* Docker image
* Perl::Critic
* Perl::Tidy
* Devel::NYTProf
* Intellij
* Features to remove
  * Support for FastCGI
  * Oracle Ticket-Database
  * DB2 Ticket-Database
* Features to add
  * SQLite backend, might be useful for devel and testing
* Check the adaptions done in O-Fork
